# Linear-circular-convolution
The aim of this laboratory is to investigate the mathematical mechanisms behind digital convolution, both linear and circular. Convolution in the discrete time domain involves convolving an input sequence 𝑥[𝑛] with a system impulse response h[𝑛] which represents the system characterises, to produce a third signal which is the convolution sum 𝑦[𝑛]. For example, if we had a noisy input signal, we could apply a filter to the input signal, to produce a filtered output signal. Digital convolution is conducted in the discrete time domain and is comprised of the mathematical mechanisms of shifting, multiplication, and summation.
Circular convolution is conducted in the frequency domain and means that we can simply multiply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the input sequence with the FFT of the impulse response to yield the convolution sum; we can then use an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to convert the convolution sum back to the time domain. Even though we must convert the input sequence 𝑥[𝑛] to the frequency domain to produce 𝑋[𝑛], and also the impulse response h[𝑛] to produce 𝐻[𝑘] and then multiply them together to produce the convolution sum, we do not have to time reverse a sequence, shift, and sum as we would for linear convolution. Thus, circular convolution is faster than linear convolution. Hence it is known as fast convolution.
